;;; ToDo:
;;; * test negate function
;;; * test exp function
;;; * test flipped vec3 scale function and recip vec3 scale function
;;; * add fixnum type and its operations
;;; * if expression and boolean type
;;; * with-fixnum, with-scalar and with-vec3 external environment interfaces
;;; * add sph example
;;; * array addition example as fast as C
;;; * type declaration for external environment reference in expressions for performance optimization
;;;
;;; Done:
;;; * add exp function
;;; * add more tests for binarization
;;; * add n-body example
;;; * add macros to defvar scalar-array and vec3-array variables type declaimed for performance optimization
;;; * add norm function whose type is vec3 -> scalar
;;; * export scalar and vec3 operations defined by cl-tuples
;;; * add operation interfaces including scalar and vec3 operations
;;; * automatic binarization of arithmetic operations, which enables to write forms like (+ a b c) and expands it to (+ (+ a b) c)
;;; * implementation of vec3 arithmetic using cl-tuples
;;; * reference to external environment: variables and array variables
;;; * register to github
;;; * type-of-application
;;; * function application
;;; * packaging as library and separation of tests into another file
