;;; ToDo:
;;; * add norm function whose type is vector -> scalar
;;; * if expression and boolean type
;;;
;;; Done:
;;; * export scalar and vector operations defined by cl-tuples
;;; * add operation interfaces including scalar and vector operations
;;; * automatic binarization of arithmetic operations, which enables to write forms like (+ a b c) and expands it to (+ (+ a b) c)
;;; * implementation of vector arithmetic using cl-tuples
;;; * reference to external environment: variables and array variables
;;; * register to github
;;; * type-of-application
;;; * function application
;;; * packaging as library and separation of tests into another file
